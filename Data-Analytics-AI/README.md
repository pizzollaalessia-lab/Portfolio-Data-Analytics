**This project focuses on identifying fraudulent activities in financial transactions using advanced classification algorithms.**

Objective: Developing a robust pipeline for detecting fraudulent patterns in highly imbalanced credit datasets.

Techniques: Feature engineering, handling class imbalance (SMOTE/undersampling), and evaluating models using Precision-Recall curves and F1-scores.

Impact: Enhancing financial security by minimizing false negatives in fraud detection systems
